    <h3>Ciao! My name is Catherine. I am a multimedia designer based in Los Angeles. Welcome to my page!</h3>
    <p>
      I graduated from UCI with a bachelor in Business Economics. I'm currently working as a marketing assistant in Azusa, CA. The computer I use is a MacBook Air.

      I don't have any experience in coding. While watching the videos for week 1, I was overwhelmed as everything as so foreign to me. As I watched the video for the second time, everything started to make more sense. At the end of part 2, I was so frustrated that my website didn't update the next changes. Turned out that I had to do a hard refresh to clear all the caches.
